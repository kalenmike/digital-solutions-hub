    ::
    ::card{title="Complex & Messy CMS Structure" icon="i-lucide-database"}
    Nested items were incorrectly linked, unnecessary database columns cluttered the system, and the CMS architecture made content management overly complicated.

    ::card{title="Unintuitive Admin Experience" icon="i-lucide-settings-2"}
    The backend interface was difficult to use, increasing the learning curve and creating friction for everyday content updates.

    To modernize the website while **preserving the client’s familiarity**, we carefully selected a stack that allowed for both **efficiency and continuity**:
    
    - **CMS:** OctoberCMS – maintained the familiar CMS environment the client was used to, while enabling a fully customized backend and streamlined content management  
    - **Frontend Templating:** Twig – integrated the new design into a responsive, modern layout while keeping the templating system consistent with the original site  
    - **Backend:** PHP – improved database schema, optimized relations, and built a custom dashboard for better content management  
    - **Database:** SQL – corrected nested item relations, removed unnecessary columns, and enhanced efficiency for managing products and services  
    - **Custom Dashboard:** Tailored admin interface for easy content updates, header/logo changes, and analytics/pixel management  
    - **Hosting & Infrastructure:** Migrated the site to new hosting with DNS and email setup to ensure seamless operation  
    - **Performance Enhancements:** Lazy loading images, responsive 16:9 scrollable screenshot simulation, and optimized backend queries  
    
      ::note
      By retaining the core CMS while modernizing the frontend and backend, we **reduced the learning curve for the client** and ensured a smooth transition to the new, more efficient website.
